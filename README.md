# AD9851 - DDS Module Controller Library for Arduino (written in C)
This library utilizes any Arduino pins to be used as AD9851 control pins. This will gives you flexibility to use or to reserve any Arduino pins for other functions. The drawback, the frequency update rate will be somewhat limited to the `digitalWrite()` function's clock cycle.

## Instalation
* Download as .zip
* Open Arduino IDE.
* From **Sketch**, **Include Library --> Add .ZIP Library...**
* Choose the downloaded .zip. (when downloaded, more likely be named **MyGPS-master.zip**)
* Restart the Arduino IDE
